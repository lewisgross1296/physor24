\Abstract{OpenMC is a state-of-the art, \gls{os} Monte Carlo transport code. This work uses OpenMC for depletion analysis of the \gls{vtb} \gls{gcmr}. This microreactor features a prismatic, \gls{triso}-fueled, gas-cooled for an infinite-assembly model. Since this reactor is intended for load-following, a depletion analysis was run at 100\%, 50\%, and 10\% of the rated power (225 kWt) for both explicitly represented \gls{triso} and volume-homogenized fuel. The time steps used were twice as long and ten times as long for the lower power cases, respectively, to ensure the same total burnup occurred at each time step. The isotopics after one year of operation at steady-state were compared at each power for both fidelities.}

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:intro}
For advanced reactors, especially those in the early stages, sufficient \gls{ms} is required to ensure the success of the design concept. The \gls{vtb} \cite{vtb2023} is a repository of reactor models used for research and demonstration of current tools in the nuclear industry as a part of the \gls{neams} initiative. Various types of reactors are available on the \gls{vtb}; microreactors are one viable class of next generation systems. [TODO add microreactor refs as appropriate]
